## 🤔 The Problem

Every day, **corporations, remote workers, and freelancers face relentless surveillance and tracking**.

- ISPs log every corporate domain you visit.
- Ad networks track user behavior across thousands of sites.
- Without a centralized VPN, remote workers are exposed on public WiFi and 4G.
- Enterprise-grade firewall, AdBlock, and VPN solutions are typically complex, expensive, and require dedicated IT teams to maintain.

You need a professional, reliable, and secure environment.

## 🚀 Quickstart (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Flash the Image 💾

1. Download **`invisix-distro.img`** from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/invisix/files/release1/invisix-distro.img/download).
2. Download [**Raspberry Pi Imager**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
3. Open it and select:
   - **Device**: Raspberry Pi 4
   - **OS**: Scroll to bottom → "Use Custom" → select `invisix-distro.img`
   - **Storage**: Your SD card
4. Click **Next** → **"NO"** to editing settings (already configured!) → **Write**.

### Step 2: Activate Free VPN (Optional) ✨

> *Skip this if you only want local network protection.*

1. Create a free account at [**tailscale.com**](https://tailscale.com) (Google/Microsoft login works).
2. Go to **Settings → Keys → "Generate auth key"**.
3. Copy the key (`tskey-...`).
4. Open the flashed SD card on your computer (it shows up as `bootfs`).
5. Create a file named **`tailscale-auth.key`** and paste the key inside. Save.
6. Eject.

### Step 3: Plug & Play 🔌

1. SD card → Raspberry Pi.
2. Ethernet cable → Router/Switch to Pi.  
3. Power cable → Pi.
4. **Wait 5 minutes** ⏳ — it auto-configures everything.

### Step 4: The One Low-Technical Configuration Change ⚙️

To route all domain requests through Invisix, you just need to tell your router where to look:

1. Open your router's administration page (`http://192.168.1.1` or `http://192.168.0.1`).
2. Find the **DHCP** or **Local Network** settings.
3. Find `raspberrypi` in the connected devices list → enable **Static Lease** (so its IP never changes).
4. Copy its IP (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).
5. Set that IP as your network's **Primary DNS** server.

### ✅ Done!

**That's it.** Your corporate or home network is now fundamentally secure from ads and tracking telemetry.

---

## 🌍 Using It

### 🏢 At the Office / Home
Do nothing. Ads disappear. Workflows load faster. Telemetry stops. The whole team is protected.

### 💼 Remote Work (4G / Public WiFi)
1. Install the **Tailscale** client on your work device.
2. Log in.
3. Toggle the VPN ON.
4. You're now securely tunneled through your office connection — **and your VPN traffic enjoys the same AdBlocker protection.**

### 📊 Control Panel
Audit your network traffic and see what's being blocked:
- Visit `http://<YOUR-PI-IP>/admin`
- Password: `admin`

> Most networks block **30-50% of all DNS queries**. That's thousands of tracking attempts per day neutralized.
